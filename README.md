# grade-calculator

This is a command-line program that can be used to calculate weighted averages for your classes.

**INSTALLATION GUIDE** (has been tested on Windows and Mac):
1. Download grade c++ file
2. Open file with your preferred IDE
3. Build/compile the file
You can use the exe file as many times as you like by going to the build's directory

**How This Program Works:**
1. Enter your grade and then enter the percentage of that grade (ex: if the grade is 10%, then you would enter 10)
2. When alll grades have been entered, type 00 when asked for your next grade to stop the program
3. The program will then calculate your weighted average, and then ask if you would like to calculate another average. The program will end if you type no.
